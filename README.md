## Step 2: Challenge Part 2

### Explanation of the Requirement

The requirement states: “This delete user functionality can be done after authentication.” Based on my understanding of authentication and authorization, this requirement has both advantages and disadvantages.

#### Is It a Good or Bad Idea?

**Advantages:**
- **Authentication Requirement:** Ensuring that a user is authenticated before allowing actions such as deleting another user is a fundamental security measure. It confirms that the user attempting the action is indeed a legitimate user of the system.
- **Simplified Access:** In a system where all authenticated users have equal privileges, allowing such actions after authentication may be appropriate.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Lack of Authorization Check:** The major concern here is the absence of an authorization check. Authentication verifies the identity of the user, but it does not verify whether the user is permitted to perform a specific action. Allowing deletion solely after authentication can lead to unauthorized actions, such as users deleting accounts they should not have access to.
- **Potential for Misuse:** If all authenticated users are allowed to delete accounts, it could result in abuse or accidental deletion of important accounts.

### Difference Between Authentication and Authorization

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user, typically through credentials like a username and password.

**Authorization** is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do within the system, including permissions and access levels.

**Conclusion:** While authentication is essential for verifying a user's identity, authorization is crucial for ensuring that the user has the appropriate permissions to perform specific actions. Therefore, relying solely on authentication for actions like deleting users without incorporating proper authorization is not advisable.
